Add Interactivity:

Add zooming and panning functionality to explore the circular map in more detail.
Incorporate Additional Layers:

Overlay other genomic features, such as operons, transcription start sites, or regulatory elements.
Feature Tooltips:

When hovering over a gene or feature, display detailed information in a tooltip.
Dynamic Filters:

Allow users to filter by gene type (e.g., CDS, rRNA, tRNA) or product categories.
Highlight Regions:

Enable users to select and highlight specific genomic regions interactively.
Save State/Export Data:

Add functionality to save the current state of the visualization or export feature data in JSON or CSV format.
Color Themes:

Allow users to apply different color themes to the visualization.
Multiple Contigs:

Handle and display multiple contigs/chromosomes as separate concentric circles.
Integrate Additional Files:

Allow users to upload annotation files (e.g., BED, GFF) to add extra details to the visualization.
Performance Optimization:

If the dataset becomes too large, optimize rendering to improve performance.
